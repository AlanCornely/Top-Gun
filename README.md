### **Test 1: "Classic Dart" Model Airplane**

  **Distance traveled:** 9.5 meters
 
 
  **Description:**
The first model, based on the traditional "Classic Dart", had a fast initial flight, but showed a rapid decrease in altitude after 5 meters. The pointed aerodynamics guaranteed initial thrust, but the lack of stability in the wings caused the plane to dive abruptly. The central fold was critical for the launch, but the asymmetry at the ends compromised the trajectory.

### **Test 2: "Square Glider" Model Airplane**

  **Distance traveled:** 4.2 meters


  **Description:**
This model, with a more robust structure and square shape, did not maintain a straight line. The poorly adjusted folds in the wings generated immediate turbulence, causing lateral oscillations. Despite the balanced weight, the lack of aerodynamic curvature prevented lift. The plane veered to the right shortly after launch, colliding with a wall before gliding.

### **Test 3: Paper Canard Model Airplane**

 **Distance flown:** 12.1 meters


 **Description:**
Inspired by airplanes with front wings (canard), this model surprised with moderate stability. The small front wings helped to reduce nose drop, allowing a longer flight. However, after 8 meters, the right trilateral wing folded slightly, causing a gradual loss of altitude. The distance was the longest so far, but the design required precision in the folds to avoid failures.

### **Test 4: "Delta Veloz" Model Airplane**

 **Distance covered:** 7.8 meters


 **Description:**
With an elongated triangular shape, the "Delta Veloz" had a powerful launch, but entered a horizontal rotation after 3 meters, losing efficiency. The delta wing generated excessive drag at the tips, and the very rearward center of gravity caused instability. Despite this, the structural resistance prevented total collapse, allowing it to glide through the air before landing abruptly.

### **Test 5: "Flying Ring" Model Airplane**

 **Distance flown:** 2.5 meters


 **Description:**
The experimental ring-shaped model (without traditional wings) performed the worst. The circular structure created a "screw" effect immediately after launch, resulting in a near-vertical fall. The lack of supporting surfaces and the excess paper in the front made the design ineffective for gliding flight.
